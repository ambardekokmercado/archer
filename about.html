<h1>About Point Archery</h1>

<h2>Our Facilities</h2>
<p>Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with  28 shooting
     (14 -  10 yard lanes and 14 â€“ 20 yard lanes) and 2 private coaching rooms. 
     We also have access to 26  additional  20 yard lanes  and an outdoor shooting field. 
     We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time archer 
     to the professional archer. Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will 
     be given the basic safety instruction to start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.</p>


<h2>About Our Programming </h2>
<p>From Beginner to Elite, archers of all ages and ability learn about this exciting Olympic and
     international sport. Sign up for a group lesson, private class, schedule a birthday or 
     corporate party or compete at one of our many tournaments.  Straight to the Point Archery 
     also offers homeschooling programs, kids club events, YMCA classes, Boy and Girl Scouts achievement
      programs and several other youth group activities. We are dedicated to teaching valuable life skills 
      to the youth in our community through the wonderful discipline of archery.</p>
